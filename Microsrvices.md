# What is an architecture?
The term _architecture_ in software development refers to the basic design i.e a blue print decided by the developer to frame his application.
Developers decide the architecture for their applications based on the idea to achieve their desired goals from the applications.

### Microservice architecture
This architecture is inspired from the modularization concept that was previously implemented on monolithic architecture but due to ever-growing size of data the modularity faded and the ultimate goal of **loosely coupled & highly cohesive** service failed.
